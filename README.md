### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis

### Description
This Python project uses the bikeshare data for **New York City, Chicago and Washington**. The user can analyse the data filtering by *city, month and weekday*.

Possible operations on the data are:

* finding the most common month / weekday / hour when the trips began;
* finding the most popular:
  * route;
  * start station;
  * end station;
* calculating total and average trip durations;
* displaying statistics on bikeshare users such as gender and birth year (not available for **Washington**).

The user may also access the raw data if needed.

### Files used
- [x] chicago.csv
- [x] new_york_city.csv
- [x] washington.csv

### Credits
